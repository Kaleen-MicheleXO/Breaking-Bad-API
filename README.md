# Hows it Made:
**Tech used:** HTML/CSS & Javascript <br>
I used an API to retrieve the data. <br>
Type a number 1-57 in the search box and it will give you a character from the TV series breaking bad.
It will tell you the characters name, birthday, nickname,occupation and a image of what they look like.
